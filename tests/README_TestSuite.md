# Test Suite Documentation: Logic and Significance

## Overview
This test suite is designed to validate the core components of the `WSR` application, focusing on database integrity, helper utility reliability, and query functionality. The tests are structured using `pytest` and are integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI). This ensures all critical components behave as expected before deployment or integration.

---

## `tests/test_db.py`

### Purpose
To verify the functionality and structure of the core database utility methods in `utils/db.py`.

### Tests

#### `test_get_engine_returns_engine`
- **Logic:** Calls `get_engine()` to ensure a SQLAlchemy engine is instantiated.
- **Significance:** Confirms the application can initiate a database connection, which is foundational for all data operations.

#### `test_get_metadata_returns_metadata`
- **Logic:** Calls `get_metadata()` and checks for the presence of `tables` attribute in the returned metadata object.
- **Significance:** Validates that the database schema is accessible and that metadata reflection works correctly, which is critical for dynamic table access.

#### `test_get_table_known`
- **Logic:** Fetches a known table (e.g., `"employees"`) using `get_table(name)` and checks if expected columns exist.
- **Significance:** Ensures that essential tables are present in the database and contain expected schema, preventing runtime errors in dependent logic.

#### `test_get_table_unknown_raises`
- **Logic:** Attempts to fetch a non-existent table and expects a `KeyError`.
- **Significance:** Validates error handling for invalid table access, helping to catch and log issues early during development.

## `tests/test_helpers.py`

### Purpose
To confirm that individual utility functions behave consistently and reliably, especially when transforming data or handling insertion logic.

### Tests
Several tests exist in this file (details redacted here for brevity), but they typically focus on:

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring date and numeric transformations work as expected.
- **Insertion Logic:** Verifying that helper functions correctly prepare or sanitize records before inserting into the database.
- **Mocked Side Effects:** Some tests use `MagicMock` to simulate behavior like employee lookups or time period conversions.

### Significance
Helper functions are reused across multiple modules. Testing them thoroughly reduces redundancy in debugging and ensures centralized logic remains bug-free.

---

## `tests/test_queries.py`

### Purpose
To test any custom SQL or ORM queries implemented in a `queries.py` utility or report generator module.

### Tests
Basic test confirms that at least one query runs and returns a plausible result set.

### Significance
Prevents silent failures in dashboard widgets or PDF reporting tools that depend on these queries. Ensures correctness of business logic tied to metrics, charts, or insights.

---

## CI/CD Integration

All tests are run automatically on each push to the main branch via GitHub Actions:
- **Failing a test = Block deployment.**
- **Passing tests = Signals readiness for merging or deploying changes.**

This minimizes risk and ensures every code change respects previously working logic.

## Summary

| Test File              | Primary Target               | Risk Mitigated                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `test_db.py`           | DB schema + connection       | Missing tables, bad connection strings    |
| `test_helpers.py`      | Utility logic                | Silent data corruption or transform bugs  |
| `test_queries.py`      | Report queries               | Broken metrics, failed insights generation|
