## Usage Tips

- All **dashboards use sidebar filters and reset buttons** (date, vendor, contractor, workstream).
- **Submitters** can dynamically add rows using spreadsheet-like editors.
- **Accomplishments** allow up to 5 entries per person per week.
- All charts are **interactive**: hover, zoom, or download.
- Exports are cleanly formatted and filtered for leadership-ready deliverables.
- Contractor non-reporting checks highlight missing submissions.
- Caching minimizes DB load and speeds up navigation.
- Error handling gracefully handles offline DB or empty datasets.

---

## Data Quality & Integrity

- All inputs are normalized (case, whitespace, etc.) before database insert.
- Enum fields (e.g., `"planned"`, `"unplanned"`) are enforced in lowercase.
- Unique hash keys prevent duplicates.
- Schema interactions are safely abstracted using SQLAlchemy core.
- Auditing columns track record creation.
- Foreign key integrity ensures clean relations.

- Role-based access (submitters vs viewers)
- Scheduled reminders for missing reports
- Monthly/Quarterly trend reports
- Mobile-friendly layout
